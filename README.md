Terhal is an interactive educational game that combines learning and fun. In this game, players 
will explore different regions of Saudi Arabia, searching for treasures that highlight Saudi 
Arabiaâ€™s rich cultural heritage. Each discovered treasure provides players with valuable 
information about the region's history and significance. The primary goal of this project is to 
create an interactive platform that uses computer graphics techniques to provide an engaging and 
informative experience.

This game is set in two historically and culturally significant Saudi environments: Al-Diriyah and Al-Ula. Developed using Unity, it allows players to explore these areas and learn about their heritage through immersive gameplay and interactive elements.

# Environments

# Al-Diriyah:
Explore the traditional mud-brick architecture and discover items like the Saudi coffee Dallah, cups, and dates. Informative pop-ups provide historical context and cultural insights as players interact with these items.
# Al-Ula:
Discover the ancient rock formations and archaeological sites, including the "Al-Ula Oasis Pool." Continue the treasure hunt with informative pop-ups detailing Al-Ula's rich history and culture.
